## Smart Home Automation Project
This Project is designed in 2014 and assembled on more than 150 home in iran

## STM32F103RBT6
The STM32F103xx medium-density performance line family incorporates the high-
performance ARM ® Cortex ® -M3 32-bit RISC core operating at a 72 MHz frequency, high-
speed embedded memories (Flash memory up to 128 Kbytes and SRAM up to 20 Kbytes),
and an extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected to two APB buses. All
devices offer two 12-bit ADCs, as well as standard and advanced communication interfaces: up to two I 2 Cs and SPIs, three USARTs, an USB and a CAN.

* PLC (Programmable logic controller) Serial Port Connection
* FAT File System read sound voices 
* Connect To MT8888C Process 
* Connect to VS1003 Via SPI Protocol for Play Voices
* Debugger Serial Port

## ATmega8A-AU
The ATmega8 is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVR RISC architecture.
By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega8 achieves throughputs
approaching 1 MIPS per MHz, allowing the system designer to optimize power consumption ver-
sus processing speed.

- Connect to PT2264 remote control encoder and receive commands

## SIM900
SIMCom presents an ultra compact and reliable wireless module-SIM900. This is a complete Quad-band GSM/GPRS module in a SMT type and designed with a very powerful single-chip processor integrating AMR926EJ-S core, allowing you to benefit from small dimensions and cost-effective solutions.

## PT2264
PT2264 is a remote control encoder paired with PT2294 utilizing CMOS Technology. It encodes data
and address pins into a serial coded waveform suitable for RF modulation. PT2264 has a maximum of
12-bit of tri-state address pins providing up to 531,441 (or 312) address codes; thereby, drastically
reducing any code collision and unauthorized code scanning possibilities. 

- 12 Chanel input remote control. for example of usage: lighting control, open door, music ...
