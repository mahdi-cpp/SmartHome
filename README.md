## PT2264
PT2264 is a remote control encoder paired with PT2294 utilizing CMOS Technology. It encodes data
and address pins into a serial coded waveform suitable for RF modulation. PT2264 has a maximum of
12-bit of tri-state address pins providing up to 531,441 (or 312) address codes; thereby, drastically
reducing any code collision and unauthorized code scanning possibilities. 


* 12 Chanel input remote control. for example of usage: lighting control, open door, music ...
